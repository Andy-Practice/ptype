ptype is a probabilistic approach to type inference which is the task of identifying the data type (e.g., Boolean, date, integer and string) of a given column of data.

Existing approaches often fail on type inference for messy datasets, as the task becomes challenging in the presence of missing data and anomalies. With ptype_, our goal is to develop a robust method that can deal with such entries.

    Normal, missing and anomalous values are denoted by green, yellow and red, respectively in the right hand figure.

ptype is built upon Probabilistic Finite-State Machines (PFSMs) which are used to model known data types, missing and anomalous data. We combine PFSMs such that a data column can be annotated via probabilistic inference in the proposed model, i.e., given a column of data we can infer column type and rows with missing and anomalous values. In contrast to standard use of FSMs (e.g., regular expressions) that either accepts or rejects a given data value, PFSMs provide probabilities and therefore offers the advantage of generating weighted predictions even when a column of data is consistent with more than one type model.
