Type inference refers to the task of inferring the data type (e.g., Boolean, date, integer and string) of a given column of data, which becomes challenging in the presence of missing data and anomalies.

    Normal, missing and anomalous values are denoted by green, yellow and red, respectively in the right hand figure.

ptype_ is a probabilistic type inference model for tabular data, which aims to robustly infer the data type for each column in a table of data. By taking into account missing data and anomalies, ptype improves over the existing type inference methods. This repository provides an implementation of ptype in Python.
