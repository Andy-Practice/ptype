# Introduction
Type inference refers to the task of inferring the data type (e.g., Boolean, date, integer and string) of a given column of data, which becomes challenging in the presence of missing data and anomalies.

[ptype](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10618-020-00680-1.pdf) is a probabilistic type inference model for tabular data, which aims to robustly infer the data type for each column in a table of data. By taking into account missing data and anomalies, ptype improves over the existing type inference methods. This repository provides an implementation of ptype in Python.
